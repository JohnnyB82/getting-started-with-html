<h2>The Basics of the web</h2>
<h3>With John Bratschitsch</h4>

<p><b>The Beginning</b><br>
The web was created in the 1990's. There are multiple pieces in place for it to send and receive 
data to and from the user. It all starts with yourself and a browser. Your browser makes an HTTP
request to a server. The server upon receiving the request locates the information/document and 
sends it back. One of the most common type of documents is HTML. Once the information is sent back, 
your browser interprets the data and displays it for you.
</p>

<p><b><b>HTML - <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em></b></b><br>
An HTML document is made up of text, markup, references to other documents, and links. All of this
 prepared in a way that your browser can understand. It contains tags and elements to tell your browser
   what and how to display your content. One example is using a tag to <b>bold</b> text.
 </p>
 <p>Tags go much deeper than just <b>bolding</b> or adding <em>italics</em>. You can also add attributes.
  Such as using an anchor tag to create an <a href="www.udacity.com">href</a> attribute. The value of "href" was set to
   www.udacity.com.</p>

<p><b>Inline and Block Elements</b><br>
These both work very differently. Knowing the difference can come in quite handy as they both
 have uses for different situations. <b>Block</b> elements for instance, form a virtual box box around the opening
 and closing tags. Where as <b>Inline</b> elements do not. A good example of an inline element would be the bold tag.
 A good example of block would be the paragraph tag. An Inline tag that may confuse people would be the < br > line break tag.
 </p>
 
 <p><b>Closing Notes</b><br>
 With the introductions to the basics at a close, some of the key lessons I learned are:<br>
 -<b>Tags</b>: Always contained within angled brackets. Most have closing < /p > tag. But there are some that are void like < br >.<br>
 -<b>Elements</b>: These reger to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.<br>
 -<b>Attributes</b>: Property of an HTML element. The example taught was the HREF attribute. Where we set it to point to the URL www.udacity.com.
